I hope I'm doing this right.

Hi, this is where I'll be hosting all of my engine config files from my sound pack located here:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2971114961

Typically you can expect a new engine config within 24 hours of a new soundset being added to the pack.
Enjoy!
